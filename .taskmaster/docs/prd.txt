# Product Requirements Document
## ElizaOS Claude Code Plugin

### Project Overview
The ElizaOS Claude Code Plugin enables AI agents built with ElizaOS to autonomously modify, analyze, and improve codebases using the Claude Code SDK. This plugin bridges the gap between conversational AI agents and practical code automation, allowing developers to create agents that can understand requirements, implement features, fix bugs, and refactor code through natural language interactions.

### Problem Statement
Developers currently face significant friction when trying to integrate AI-powered code modification capabilities into their autonomous agents. While Claude Code provides powerful code editing capabilities through its SDK, and ElizaOS offers a robust framework for building AI agents, there is no seamless way to combine these technologies. This results in:
- Manual intervention required for code modifications
- Limited ability to create fully autonomous development assistants
- Lack of standardized patterns for AI-driven code automation
- Difficulty in maintaining context across code modification sessions

### Target Users
1. **Primary Users**: Developers building AI agents with ElizaOS who want to add code modification capabilities
2. **Secondary Users**: Development teams looking to automate repetitive coding tasks
3. **Tertiary Users**: Open source maintainers wanting to automate PR reviews and code improvements

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture
- Plugin architecture following ElizaOS standards
- Modular action system for extensibility
- Event-driven communication between components
- Support for streaming responses
- Asynchronous operation handling

#### Dependencies
- ElizaOS core framework (latest version)
- Claude Code SDK (TypeScript and/or Python)
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+
- Git for version control operations
- Optional: GitHub API, GitLab API

#### API Requirements
- RESTful API endpoints for external integrations
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Comprehensive error responses

#### Performance Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds for simple operations
- Support for operations on codebases up to 1GB
- Concurrent operation handling
- Efficient memory usage
- Caching mechanisms for repeated operations

### User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to tell my ElizaOS agent to "implement a REST API endpoint for user authentication" and have it generate the complete implementation.

2. **As a team lead**, I want my agent to review pull requests and suggest improvements based on our coding standards.

3. **As an open source maintainer**, I want to automate the process of updating dependencies and fixing breaking changes.

4. **As a developer**, I want my agent to understand my project structure and make contextually appropriate modifications.

5. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to use natural language to update CI/CD configurations across multiple repositories.

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up plugin structure and boilerplate
- Implement basic Claude Code SDK integration
- Create simple file creation and modification actions
- Basic error handling and logging

#### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement code analysis actions
- Add context management and memory
- Create project structure understanding
- Implement multi-file operations

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- GitHub integration
- Automated testing implementation
- Code review capabilities
- Performance optimizations

#### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation (Week 7)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example implementations
- Performance testing
- Security audit

### Success Metrics
1. **Adoption Rate**: 100+ developers using the plugin within 3 months
2. **Code Quality**: 90%+ success rate for code modifications
3. **Performance**: Average response time under 2 seconds
4. **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating on user feedback
5. **Community Engagement**: 20+ community contributions

### Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk**: API rate limits from Claude
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and batch operations

2. **Risk**: Code modifications breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Automated testing before applying changes

3. **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in generated code
   - **Mitigation**: Security scanning and best practices enforcement

4. **Risk**: High token usage costs
   - **Mitigation**: Efficient prompt engineering and context management

### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional AI models
- Visual Studio Code extension
- Web-based interface for non-technical users
- Multi-language support beyond TypeScript/Python
- Integration with more development tools
- AI pair programming features

### Conclusion
The ElizaOS Claude Code Plugin will revolutionize how developers interact with AI agents for code automation. By combining the conversational capabilities of ElizaOS with the powerful code modification features of Claude Code SDK, we'll enable a new generation of autonomous development assistants that can understand, analyze, and improve codebases through natural language interactions.
